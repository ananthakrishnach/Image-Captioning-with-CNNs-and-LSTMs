##Visual Text Composer

An image captioning model, generates a coherent, contextually appropriate description that is both syntactically and semantically accurate.
Dataset - Flickr8k - consists of 8000 images, each annotated with five different captions.
This image-to-sequence architecture uses a convolutional neural network(CNN) to encode the image and an LSTM to decode it.
